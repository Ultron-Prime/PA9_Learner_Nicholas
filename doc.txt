This is the documentation for Nicholas Learner's Proj9 for CS 202-1001 at UNR, due @ midnight, 11-20-19.

The purpose of this program is to create (declare), implement, and use (test) ArrayQueue and NodeQueue
objects, within provided specifications.

All of the tests are listed when the program is run using the Makefile.

A few notes:
front() and back() for NodeQueue were not directly tested in the running program (you can see these tests
commented out in proj9.cpp) because they caused a segmentation fault.
pop() was not tested on an empty ArrayQueue or NodeQueue object.
Out of all the methods in either ArrayQueue or NodeQueue, only NodeQueue's destructor outputs a message to
the console.

If I were to spend more time on the project, I would add bounds-checking before trying to test front() and
back(), and I would clean up the testing process by adding a message in all of each class' methods.
